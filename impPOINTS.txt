 also remember:-
 Identifiers can be composed to letters,digits and the underscore character. They are sequence that make up a name ex.a1,_b3 . The can only be started with letter or an underscore.  
 they are case sensitive upper and lower case are distinct. c++ language mposes no limit on name length. The language reserves a set of names for its own use these names may not be used as identifers ex.cout .
